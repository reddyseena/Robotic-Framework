Overview or Architecture :
Inside integration development Environment we create a script file which is a text file with the extension .robot and the .robot files will refer the workflow  files and on the top of the script file we will attach one or more libraries like 
	• Robot Framework = Overview script Layders::
Script(.robot)
Selenium2 Library
Selenium Webdriver
	• Sections of the script file : sections which we have to write in .robot file ::
1.settings
2.Variables
3.Test cases
4.Keywords(optional)
 Example :  Amazon.robot
*** Settings ***
*** Variables *** 
*** Test Cases ***
*** Keywords ***

If I want a keywords/resources then I will go to robotframework.org and I will click on the Test libraries External and we will find the libraries we want and suppose if we click on the selenium2 library and we should find the Keyword Documentation and click on it and we will find the keywords arguments.

SeleniumLibrary :  selenium library is a web testing library for robot framework.
Robot Framework :  if I want to hold manual testing and continue with automation testing then the robot framework is a correct one. It uses some python convention in scripts and we should write few resources/keywords in *.robot file when we run robot/pybot -d results *.robot then it looks for a specified file and executes the resources which we are declared in the script.

Robot script file has a format and it's look like 4 sections ::  1. Settings 2.Variables 3.Test cases 4.Keywords
